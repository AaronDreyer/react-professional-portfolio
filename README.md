  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  This is my professional portfolio using React.js. This is to set a portfolio to represent me in the software engineering industry. This also demonstrates my styling abilities and my ability to use React to create an application.

  I created this application for a challenge in the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp and for representation in the industry.

  Someone can use this application to view my career in Software Engineering and to learn how a React.js application is coded and structured.
